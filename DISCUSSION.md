## Solace Assessment Notes

### Further Features to Consider
1. API endpoint security/logging
2. Consider switching to an ORM that provides better static typing (Sequelize, TypeORM, etc)
3. Search endpoint should support pagination
4. Front-end should also support pagination
5. Tailwind is good for layout, but other CSS frameworks would be helpful for consistent styling (Bootstrap, Material, etc.)
6. Searching across that many text fields will be very slow. Consider at the very least some indexes
